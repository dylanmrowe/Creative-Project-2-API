***Try fullscreen!!! More game functionality coming soon***
Try the game out here: http://ec2-52-34-83-155.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/201/blocks/index.html

Overview
===========================
Uses a web audio api to grab sounds from soundcloud and inserts them in an open-source music visualizer, all adding a cool background to a simple brick-breaker game. The game was programmed in Javascript with Phaser (a javascript game-writing library).

Ideas
=====
- Add more block types; the visualizer adds a lot of potential to this. I want to make blocks that affect the visualizer.
- Make the visualizer work when not fullscreen (I just can't figure this out.)

Help & Inspiration
==================
Thanks to Mat Preziotte for the audio visualizer functionality, and Phaser for their awesome game structure libraries.
